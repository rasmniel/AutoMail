# WoW AddOn: AutoMail
This AddOn is made for World of Warcraft and goes well with version 1.12 and below (vanilla).
It is like even usable until mails start containing several items, at which point it may still work, although be less efficient.

# AutoMail features
Empties your mailbox and keeps spammers away.
Will not claim items with a COD amount attached to them.
